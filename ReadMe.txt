The purpose of this repot is to give me a chance to keep my programming skill sharp in various languages. 

How to execute code. 
R 
	Rscript <<file>> <<args,...>>
Java 
	All executable Java code is contained in the bin directory. 
	java <<file>> <<args,...>>
Python 
	python <<file>> <<args,...>>
	
Notes:
	problem_001
		-All languages are essentially using the same algorithm
	problem_002
		-Python
			-This was my initial attempt at solving the problem. The use of the bit variable was something that was mentioned in my algorithms class a while back and I wanted to try it. It removes the need to swap variables.
		-Java
			-This is based off of a crafty solution I saw in the discussion threads for this problem. It eliminates the need for testing to see if the current fib number is even and the bit variable.
